					<h2>Summary:</h2>

Let us get them done for you.</p>

					<!-- Planning -->
					<h3>Planning</h3>
					<div class="body-content photo-grid-container">
						<p>Plannning is one of my favorite parts of the process. I really enjoy sitting down, clearing my head and getting my thoughts out on pen and paper. Sometimes it just flows out, but other times it gets a bit hard to get it out. Whatever the challenge is, Speedy made it fun since I had never designed a 'delivery' type app.</p><br>

					<!-- Sketching -->
					<h3>Sketching</h3>
					<p>I knew that from the start I would have to think about what pages exactly I would need, outlining these items help smooth the process and flow that the application would take. Afterwards, sketching out my ideas became easier with set goals in mind.</p><br>

					<h3>Project Phases</h3>
					<div class="body-content">
						<p>With the phases, I tried to break up my time into chunks and determine what would happen where. This helped with keeping me accountable to deadlines which kept the process moving.</p>

					<!-- Desktop v2 -->
					<h2>Desktop v2</h2>
					<div class="body-content">
						<h3>Description:</h3>
						<p>After reviewing and recieving feedback, I decided that the best would be to simplify the page. Although there was not much going at first, I still then saw that I could simplify the process even further. I accomplished this with:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Using one main color of 'blue' throughout the page.</li>
							<li>Reduced the menu items yet still keeping the important parts.</li>
							<li>Changing the sign up process so that it is uni-directional making it more straightforward.</li>
							<li>Yes...still lots of blue.</li>
						</ul>

					<!-- Mobile -->
					<h2>Mobile</h2>
					<div class="body-content">
						<h3>Description:</h3>
						<p>After even more iterations and more feedback, Speedy quickly morphed into its better and final state. You may notice a couple of things such as a more minimalistic view as well as a color change! The blue was getting overwhelming and green seemed to fit better as green conveys 'growth', 'freshness' and most importantly for Speedy, 'safety'. We like for our users to find comfort in using our application and feel like the vibrant energy of the green portrays just that.</p>

					<h2>Live:</h2>
					<div>
						<p>Speedy is now live (but still under construction, production-wise) <a href="https://yxnely.github.io/portfolio-projects/speedy/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> and was made with Vue.js. You can check out the repo <a href="https://github.com/yxnely/portfolio-projects/tree/master/speedy" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
