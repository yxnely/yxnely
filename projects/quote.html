                    <p>For my inspirational Poster, I decided to be inspired by Mother Teresa and Dada Art. I used Mother Teresa's quote "Do small things with great love". What this quote translates, to me, is that no matter what you do, your actions should have meaning behind them. In other words, if I do something grand for somebody/something I am most likely doing it with love or I wouldn't be doing it at all, this could apply to small acts as well. Even if you are doing something small, still do it with the same love that you do everything else with. This goes along with how I laid out my project. I have a big heart in the center that catches the eye, but there are little hearts aligned in the background that also add up and make up the bigger picture, they're not just there in vain.</p><br>
                    <p>The layout of my project was inspired by Dada Art because they liked to do their own thing and be different whether it be through collages or really anything. I made a collage with my poster because each row of hearts is made from a different picture. They are then placed together in a manner where it makes sense, i.e. the night sky picture was placed at the top ending with the water at the bottom. For my final touch, I placed a bigger sized heart right in the middle to emphasize my quote and better convey my message.</p>
